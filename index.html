    <h3>First International trip</h3>

    <h4>The Domincan Republic</h4>

    <p>In 2019, my family and I traveled to Punta Cana which is in the Dominican Republic. This trip was an eye opening experience for me because I realized that there is so many amazing beautiful places and cultures that I want to see and experience. </p>

    <h3> Latest International trip</h3>

    <h4>Ireland</h4>

    <p>In the Summer of 2022 my family and I traveled to Ireland. We traveled all around the coast of Ireland and it was truly an amazing experience. It was certaintly one of my favorite trips because I got to experience my Irish culture and I met so many distant relatives who were so incredible.</p>
    
    <h3>My two favorite places in the world</h3>

    <h4>London and Rome</h4>

    <p>All of these Countries are unique and beautiful. However, my two favorite places I visited were London and Rome. My experiences and opinions on these two countries will be shared on this website.</p>
